Task ID: 1
Agent: Main Agent
Task: Clone the debugRC repository from GitHub and analyze warehouse transfer implementation in both legacy and Laravel systems, then create a comprehensive .md implementation plan

Work Log:
- Cloned https://github.com/sajidchowdhury/debugRC.git successfully
- Explored the legacy codebase: WarehouseTransferController, WarehouseTransferModel, WarehouseTransferAuditModel, JS, CSS, views
- Explored the Laravel codebase: WarehouseTransferService, WarehouseTransferController, WarehouseTransfer model, routes, views
- Read the MIGRATION_PLAN.md and schema_mapping.md for additional context
- Read the legacy WarehouseTransferModel.php and WarehouseTransferController.php in detail
- Read the Laravel WarehouseTransferService.php, WarehouseTransfer model, WarehouseTransferItem model in detail
- Read the legacy WarehouseTransfer.js client-side code
- Read the Laravel WarehouseTransferController and create.blade.php
- Identified 10 key gaps (G1-G10) between legacy and Laravel implementations
- Created comprehensive WAREHOUSE_TRANSFER_INNER_BRANCH_PLAN.md with 8 implementation phases

Stage Summary:
- Created file: /home/z/debugRC/WAREHOUSE_TRANSFER_INNER_BRANCH_PLAN.md
- Key gaps identified: Same-branch enforcement (critical), Pipeline-aware availability (high), Reversal ordering (high), Audit trail (medium), CSV export (medium), Test coverage (high), and others
- 8-phase implementation plan created covering enforcement, availability, reversal safety, audit, UI parity, export/reporting, testing, and API routes
- Document includes detailed business rule matrix, database schema reference, and file inventory

Task ID: 6-a
Agent: general-purpose
Task: Phase 6.1 + 6.2 — CSV Export method + route + Export button on index

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md to understand prior work context
- Read WarehouseTransferController.php, WarehouseTransfer model, CsvExportController.php for patterns
- Read routes/web.php (lines 520-531) for warehouse-transfers route group
- Read index.blade.php for header buttons and scripts section
- Added `createdBy()` BelongsTo relationship to WarehouseTransfer model (line 166)
- Added `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Response` import to WarehouseTransferController
- Added `export()` method to WarehouseTransferController after `print()` method (lines 370-449)
  - Same filter params as index: from_date, to_date, from_warehouse_id, to_warehouse_id, status, search
  - Branch isolation via getUserBranchId() (same pattern as index)
  - Uses cursor() for memory-efficient iteration
  - Streams CSV with BOM via Response::stream() (exact CsvExportController pattern)
  - Columns: Date, Code, From WH, To WH, Branch, Items, Amount, Demand, Reversed, Status, Created By
- Added export route in web.php (line 525) BEFORE {id} routes to avoid route collision
  - Route::get('export', [WarehouseTransferController::class, 'export'])->name('export')
- Added "Export CSV" button in index.blade.php header after Reconcile button (line 59-61)
  - <a> with id="exportCsvBtn", btn-outline-light btn-sm styling
- Added JS click handler in @push('scripts') that serializes filter form and appends to export URL (lines 331-335)

Stage Summary:
- WarehouseTransfer model now has createdBy() relationship (→ User via created_by FK)
- WarehouseTransferController now has export() method streaming BOM-prefixed CSV with branch isolation
- Route admin.warehouse-transfers.export registered before {id} routes
- Index view has Export CSV button that passes current filter params to export endpoint

Task ID: 6-b
Agent: general-purpose
Task: Phase 6.3 — Transfer Summary Report (service + controller + routes + view + ReportsCatalog + index button)

Work Log:
- Read worklog.md to understand prior work (Phase 1–5 complete, Phase 6.1/6.2 CSV export done by agent 6-a)
- Read WarehouseTransferAuditService.php for raw SQL query patterns and branchFilter pattern
- Read WarehouseTransferController.php for controller patterns, constructor injection, getUserBranchId()
- Read routes/web.php lines 520-531 for warehouse-transfers route group placement
- Read ReportsCatalog.php for r() helper signature and inventory category structure
- Read index.blade.php, checklist.blade.php, reconcile.blade.php for view design patterns
- Read Branch.php model, WarehouseTransfer.php model for schema understanding

Changes made:
1. Created /home/z/debugRC/laravel/app/Services/Stock/WarehouseTransferSummaryReport.php
   - getSummary(?int $branchId, string $dateFrom, string $dateTo): array
   - Returns: period, branches, top_products, warehouse_pairs, averages, monthly_trend
   - Uses raw SQL (DB::select) with branch isolation filter (same pattern as AuditService)
   - branchAggregates(): per-branch totals (confirmed/draft/cancelled/value)
   - topProducts(): top 10 by qty with value and transfer_count
   - warehousePairs(): top 10 from-to warehouse combinations
   - averages(): avg items/transfer, avg value/transfer, total transfers
   - monthlyTrend(): month-by-month breakdown for charting (DATE_FORMAT grouping)

2. Updated WarehouseTransferController.php
   - Added WarehouseTransferSummaryReport import
   - Added as 6th constructor parameter (after WarehouseTransferAuditLogger)
   - Added summary() method: renders summary view with branches dropdown for admin
   - Added summaryData() AJAX method: validates date_from/date_to/branch_id, calls service, returns JSON
   - Both methods placed in new "Phase 6.3" section after runReconcile()

3. Updated routes/web.php
   - Added 2 routes in warehouse-transfers prefix group BEFORE {id} routes:
     - Route::get('summary', ...) → admin.warehouse-transfers.summary
     - Route::post('summary-data', ...) → admin.warehouse-transfers.summary-data

4. Created /home/z/debugRC/laravel/resources/views/admin/warehouse-transfers/summary.blade.php
   - Orange gradient header (same as index: #ea580c → #d97706)
   - Date range filter (from/to inputs)
   - Branch dropdown (visible only for admin users)
   - "Run Report" button triggers AJAX POST to summary-data route
   - Summary cards: Total Transfers, Avg Value/Transfer, Avg Items/Transfer, Period info
   - Tables: Branch aggregates, Top 10 products, Warehouse pairs, Monthly trend
   - "Export CSV" button generates client-side CSV download
   - Follows checklist/reconcile AJAX pattern (loading spinner, results container, no-results placeholder)

5. Updated ReportsCatalog.php
   - Added warehouse_transfer_summary entry after product_movement in 'inventory' category
   - Route: admin.warehouse-transfers.summary, icon: fa-right-left, tags: [transfer, warehouse, export]
   - preset_days: 30, featured: false, filter_type: range

6. Updated index.blade.php
   - Added "Summary" button after "Reconcile" button in header action area
   - btn-outline-light btn-sm with fa-chart-bar icon
   - Links to admin.warehouse-transfers.summary route

Stage Summary:
- Full summary report pipeline complete: service → controller → routes → view → ReportsCatalog → index button
- 6 new/modified files, all following existing code patterns (AuditService SQL, checklist/reconcile view patterns, orange gradient header)
- Branch isolation enforced via getUserBranchId() + service-level branchFilter
- Client-side CSV export for summary data
