Task ID: R1
Agent: Main (Super Z)
Task: Replace select2 500-row dropdowns with live search endpoints (port sales/search_customer & sales/search_product from Legacy to Laravel)

Work Log:
- Read the existing audit report docs/sales_entry_Lg_vs_La.md for context
- Inspected Legacy SalesController::search_customer / search_product / product_by_code (legacy/app/controllers/SalesController.php lines 80-114)
- Inspected Legacy SalesModel + Helper::Search_Customers + StockAvailabilityService::searchProductsWithStock / findProductByExactCode (the actual SQL)
- Inspected Laravel SalesCartController (had ->limit(500) on Customer and Product queries)
- Inspected Laravel cart.blade.php (had @foreach over $customers and $products rendering 500 <option>s each)
- Confirmed Customer::scopeSearch and Product::scopeSearch already exist (tsvector + GIN on PgSQL, ILIKE fallback)
- Added StockAvailabilityService::searchProductsWithStock() and findProductByExactCode() — ported Legacy SQL verbatim using DB::table()->leftJoinSub()
- Added SalesCartController::searchCustomer / searchProduct / productByCode + private resolveBranchIdForRead() helper
- Removed ->limit(500) queries from SalesCartController::index(); only the pre-selected customer is loaded now
- Added 3 new routes (cart/search-customer, cart/search-product, cart/product-by-code) with throttle:90,1 / 120,1 middleware inside the existing admin/sales role:salesman,manager,admin + branch.isolation group
- Updated cart.blade.php: removed both @foreach loops, added ENDPOINTS for the 3 new routes, added productCache JS object, converted both Select2 widgets to AJAX mode (minimumInputLength:1, delay:250, processResults populates cache), rewrote addProduct change handler to read from productCache (with min/max rate hint), rewrote renderAvailability to label from productCache with option/placeholder fallbacks
- Created docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md (persistent session memory for future agents after context loss)
- Created docs/REMEDIATION_LOG.md (R1 entry with full diff summary, R2 placeholder)
- Updated docs/sales_entry_Lg_vs_La.md header with a Remediation Progress table linking to the new docs
- Manual code review of all 4 modified source files (PHP binary not available in sandbox for php -l)

Stage Summary:
- R1 COMPLETED: Live search endpoints ported from Legacy to Laravel
- 4 source files modified: StockAvailabilityService.php, SalesCartController.php, routes/web.php, cart.blade.php
- 3 new docs created/updated: SESSION_CONTEXT.md, REMEDIATION_LOG.md, sales_entry_Lg_vs_La.md (header)
- 3 new routes: admin.sales.cart.search-customer, admin.sales.cart.search-product, admin.sales.cart.product-by-code
- 2 new service methods: searchProductsWithStock(), findProductByExactCode()
- 3 new controller methods: searchCustomer(), searchProduct(), productByCode()
- No new risks; reuses existing scopes + services; rate-limited at Legacy parity (90/min search, 120/min barcode)
- Ready for git commit + push

Task ID: REVIEW-1
Agent: general-purpose (migration reviewer)
Task: Comprehensive PostgreSQL review of all migration files (excluding 04_sales.sql commission_entries issue which parent is fixing)

Work Log:
- Read all 7 SQL files in /home/z/my-project/laravel/database/sql/ (01_auth_and_master, 02_accounting, 03_stock, 04_sales, 05_purchase, 06_payment_and_misc, 07_views_triggers_constraints)
- Read all 44 migration PHP files in /home/z/my-project/laravel/database/migrations/
- Read 2025_01_01_000001_create_rcerp_schema.php orchestrator (executes SQL files 01-07 in order via splitSql() that splits on `;\n` at end of line, respecting $$ blocks)
- Cross-checked FK dependencies between SQL files and migration files
- Verified partitioning status: stock_transactions (03_stock.sql) and sales_invoices (04_sales.sql) are both created WITH `PARTITION BY RANGE` from the very first migration (2025_01_01_000001_create_rcerp_schema.php). No partitions or default partition are created in the SQL files — partitions are only created later by migration 2025_01_21_000004_set_up_table_partitioning.php.
- Confirmed PG 12-17 limitation: FK references TO partitioned tables require the referenced columns to form a UNIQUE constraint that includes the partition key. sales_invoices PK is (id, invoice_date) → `id` alone is NOT unique. Same for stock_transactions PK = (id, transaction_date).
- Verified that cash_ledger is NEVER given an `is_reversed` column (migration 2025_01_02_000002_add_is_reversed_to_sub_ledgers.php only adds it to customer_ledger, supplier_ledger, employee_ledger).
- Confirmed that pg_cron extension is only installed by migration 2025_01_20_000009_add_pg_cron_scheduled_jobs.php (line 41), but cron.schedule() calls appear in 07_views_triggers_constraints.sql (lines 1121-1156) which runs as part of the FIRST migration (2025_01_01_000001_create_rcerp_schema.php) — long before pg_cron is available.
- PHP binary not available in sandbox (which php → exit code 1), so PHP syntax checks were done via visual inspection.
- Excluded 04_sales.sql commission_entries issue (lines 211-322) since parent is fixing it.

Stage Summary:
- Total files reviewed: 44 PHP migrations + 7 SQL files = 51 files
- Total issues found: 16
- Critical issues (block migrate:fresh): 8
- High issues (functional/rollback problems): 3
- Medium issues (runtime bugs / redundant migrations): 5
- Recommended next action: Fix Critical issues #1-#8 in order of execution (05_purchase.sql first, then 06_payment_and_misc.sql, then 07_views_triggers_constraints.sql, then migrations 2025_01_04_000001, 2025_01_20_000006, 2025_01_20_000007) before re-running php artisan migrate:fresh.
