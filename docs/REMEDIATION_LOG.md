## R1 — Replace select2 500-row dropdowns with live search endpoints

- **Status:** ✅ Done
- **Date:** 2026-07-21
- **Audit reference:** `docs/sales_entry_Lg_vs_La.md` §6 (Missing Features
  in Laravel — "Live search for customer/product dropdowns")
- **Legacy ports:**
  - `sales/search_customer` → `admin.sales.cart.search-customer`
  - `sales/search_product`  → `admin.sales.cart.search-product`
  - `sales/product_by_code` → `admin.sales.cart.product-by-code`

### Problem

The Laravel cart page (`admin/sales/cart`) was pre-loading the entire
active customer list AND the entire active product list (capped at 500
rows each via `Customer::active()->limit(500)` and
`Product::active()->limit(500)` in `SalesCartController::index()`), then
dumping them as `<option>` tags inside two Select2 dropdowns. For any
real-world dataset (>500 customers or products) the dropdowns were:

1. **Incomplete** — the 500-row cap silently dropped rows beyond 500.
2. **Slow** — every page load fetched 1000+ rows from PostgreSQL and
   serialised them into HTML, even though the user typically only
   picks one customer and a handful of products per invoice.
3. **Memory-heavy on the client** — Select2 over 1000 `<option>`s
   noticeably janks the page on low-end devices.
4. **Inconsistent with Legacy** — Legacy uses live AJAX search
   (`sales/search_customer`, `sales/search_product`) returning 20/30
   rows per query, never pre-rendering the full list.

### Solution

Ported the Legacy live-search endpoints to Laravel, then rewired the
Blade Select2 dropdowns to AJAX mode.

### Files modified

1. **`laravel/app/Services/Stock/StockAvailabilityService.php`**
   - Added `searchProductsWithStock(string $term, int $branchId): array`
   - Added `findProductByExactCode(string $code, int $branchId): ?array`
   - Both use `DB::table(...)->leftJoinSub(...)` to express the
     Legacy correlated-subquery SQL in the Laravel query builder.
     The generated SQL is functionally identical to Legacy's
     `StockAvailabilityService::searchProductsWithStock()`.

2. **`laravel/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/SalesCartController.php`**
   - Added `searchCustomer(Request)` — uses `Customer::active()
     ->search($term)` (existing tsvector + GIN scope) and shapes the
     JSON to match Legacy `searchCustomers()`.
   - Added `searchProduct(Request)` — delegates to
     `StockAvailabilityService::searchProductsWithStock()`.
   - Added `productByCode(Request)` — delegates to
     `StockAvailabilityService::findProductByExactCode()`.
   - Added private `resolveBranchIdForRead(int)` helper — mirrors
     Legacy `SalesModel::resolveBranchIdForRead()`.
   - **Removed** the `->limit(500)` queries from `index()`. The
     `customers` and `products` variables are no longer passed to
     the view. Only the single pre-selected customer is loaded
     (so the `<select>` can render its label on first paint).

3. **`laravel/routes/web.php`**
   - Added three routes inside the existing `admin/sales` group
     (so they inherit `role:salesman,manager,admin` +
     `branch.isolation` middleware):
     - `GET cart/search-customer` → `cart.search-customer` (throttle 90/min)
     - `GET cart/search-product`  → `cart.search-product`  (throttle 90/min)
     - `GET cart/product-by-code` → `cart.product-by-code` (throttle 120/min)

4. **`laravel/resources/views/admin/sales/cart.blade.php`**
   - Customer `<select>`: removed the `@foreach ($customers as $customer)`
     loop. Now renders only the pre-selected customer `<option>` (if any).
   - Product `<select>`: removed the `@foreach ($products as $product)`
     loop. Now renders only the empty placeholder `<option>`.
   - Added three new entries to the JS `ENDPOINTS` object:
     `searchCustomer`, `searchProduct`, `productByCode`.
   - Added a new `productCache` JS object (id → full product payload)
     populated by the AJAX `processResults` callback.
   - Converted both Select2 initialisations to AJAX mode
     (`ajax: { url, delay: 250, data, processResults, cache: true }`,
     `minimumInputLength: 1`).
   - Rewrote the `addProduct` change handler to consult `productCache`
     for `default_rate` / `min_rate` / `max_rate` / `available_qty`,
     with graceful fallback to `<option>` data attributes for back-compat.
     Rate hint now shows the min–max range when available.
   - Rewrote `renderAvailability` to label the product from
     `productCache` (with fallbacks to the option text and a bare
     `#id` placeholder), since the option list is no longer
     pre-rendered.

### Verification

- Manual code review of all four files. No syntax errors found.
- Confirmed no remaining references to `$customers` or `$products`
  in `cart.blade.php`.
- Confirmed RBAC inheritance: the new routes are inside the existing
  `admin/sales` route group with `role:salesman,manager,admin` +
  `branch.isolation` middleware.
- Confirmed rate-limit parity with Legacy (90 req/min for searches,
  120 req/min for barcode lookup).
- PHP binary is not available in the sandbox; `php -l` was not run.
  The user should run `php artisan route:list | grep sales.cart` in
  their dev environment to verify the three new routes are registered.

### Risks introduced

- **No new risks.** The new endpoints reuse existing scopes
  (`Customer::scopeSearch`, `Product::scopeSearch`) and existing
  services (`StockAvailabilityService`). No new DB writes, no new
  privileged operations.
- **Minor UX change:** the customer dropdown placeholder now reads
  "Type customer name / code / mobile" instead of "Select a customer"
  (because typing is now the only way to populate it). This is
  intentional and matches Legacy UX.
- **Minor perf consideration:** each search request hits PostgreSQL
  with an ILIKE query (or tsvector query if the migration has run).
  The `throttle:90,1` rate limiter caps abuse. Existing GIN indexes
  on `search_vector` (migration `2025_01_20_000005`) make the
  tsvector path fast.

### Follow-ups (NOT part of R1)

- Wire the barcode-scanner input field (if/when added to the cart
  page) to `admin.sales.cart.product-by-code`.
- Consider porting the same live-search pattern to other Laravel
  Blade pages that still use 500-row dropdowns (e.g. purchase order,
  sales return). Out of scope for R1.
